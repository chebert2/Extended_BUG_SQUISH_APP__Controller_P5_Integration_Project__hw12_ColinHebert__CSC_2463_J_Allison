# The main code from my work is found in two places: in the JS folder's file 'sketch.js'  and in the joystic_control_ino folder's file 'joystic_control_ino.ino' .  I also implemented the libraries p5.js, tone.js, p5.serialport.js, and PDMSerial.cpp (with the associated header file, 'PDMSerial.h'). 


# It is important to note that: I electively merged the contents of 'PDMSerial.js' and my main javascript subroutine file (, 'sketch.js',). I did this to allow the serialEvent data response/write-out interface method to control media input/output routing events.


# The arduino r3 uno device that I used was given uploaded programming assignment orders of the compiled file  'joystic_control_ino.ino' .

# To run..., follow these guidelines ... :

# Given the necessary TONE.js and p5.js libraries, just launch the projects root folder with VSCODE, setup a server, and view with Firefox/CHROME.
